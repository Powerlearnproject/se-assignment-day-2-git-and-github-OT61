## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Answer:
Version controlsystems like Git help maintain code integrity by tracking changes, enabling collaboration, and providing a safety net for reverting changes. GitHub is a popular platform that hosts Git repositories, offering features like community engagenment, issue tracking, and CI/CD integration.


## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Answer:
The following steps are involved in setting up a new repository on GitHub:
1. Sign in to GitHub - A GitHub account needs to be created if the user does't have one.
2. Create a New Repository - In the top right corner, click on the "+" icon and select "New Repository".
3. Repository Name and Description - Choose a descriptive name for your repository. Adding a description is optional and not compulsory.
4. Repository Type - Here, the user will decide if the repository should be public (accessible to everyone) or private (available to only to user and collaborators).
5. Initialize with README.md file - A README file provides information about the project. GitHub recommends initializing the repository with a README file.
6. Choose a License - Here, user can select aon open-source license (e.g MIT, Apache, GNU) to define the terms in which others can use your code.
7. Create the Repository - Once the above steps have been completed, click on the "Create repository" button to complete the setup.
A list of some important Decisions:
1. Public vs. Private - Considering your needs and the nature of the project, it is important to consider whether you want your project to be publicly accessible or kept private.
2. README.md File - Decide what information you want to include in the README file, e.g. project description, installation instruction, useage examples, and contribution guidelines.
3. License - Choose an appropriate open-source license that very much aligns with your project's goalsand the way you want others to use and contribute to your code.
4. Repository Structure - Keep your project organized and maintainable by planning the overall structure of your repository, including directories and files.
5. Gitignore File - Determine which files or directories that should be excluded from your reposirory (e.g. compiled binaries, temporary files) and create a .gitignore file.
6. Continuous Integrtion/Deployment - Consider integrating your repository with CI/CD tools (e.g. GitHbu actions) to automate testing, building, and deployment of your project.
7. Collaborators - In case you decide you want to work with a team, decide who you want to grant access to your repository and their respective permissions (read, write, admin).
